Originally from Estonia, I moved to the UK for high school studies as an
<a href="https://www.hmc.org.uk/about-hmc/projects/">HMC scholar</a> in 2009 and received my BA (<i>Hons</i>) and
MEng (<i>Hons</i>) degrees in chemical engineering and biotechnology from Trinity College, University of Cambridge in 2014.</p>
		
	<p align="justify">In 2014, I started my PhD studies in biophysical chemistry in the
<a href="https://www-knowles.ch.cam.ac.uk/">research group of prof. Tuomas Knowles</a> at the Department of Chemistry,
University of Cambridge, during which I was also an <a href="http://embo.org/">EMBO</a> visiting fellow in the
<a href="https://weitzlab.seas.harvard.edu/">research group of prof. David Weitz</a> at Harvard University. </p>

	<p>In 2018, I was awarded a fellowship by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council for post-doctoral
research. As of 2019, I am working as a <a href="https://schmidtsciencefellows.org/">Schmidt Science Fellow</a> between the
research groups of <a href="https://www-knowles.ch.cam.ac.uk/">prof. Tuomas Knowles</a> and
<a href="https://www.alpha-lee.com/"> Alpha Lee</a>.</p>

	<p align="justify">I care strongly about communicating my research and I have given numerous talks on topics such as chemical
engineering, protein science, biophysics, nanoscience to high school students and general audience. I am always open to
talking to students or any other audiences about these topics or about science and engineering more generally.</p>

I was a world-ranked tennis player as a junior (Tennis Europe U16 #46; ITF Juniors No. #684) and I am 22 time
Estonian Junior Champion. During my University studies, I played for the University Women's Tennis team winning seven
lawn tennis blues - Â the highest number in the history of the tennis
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_University_Lawn_Tennis_Club#Varsity_match">Varsity matches</a>. I also won
the University Tennis Championships (Sir Geoffrey Cass Cup) as well as the Cambridgeshire Country Championships on multiple
occasions. </p>	



	<p align="justify"> I have on multiple occasions won the unofficial world championships in 
<a href="https://miksike.eu/#pranglimine/training">mental arithmetics</a> and, in 2007, I won the "Estonia's got talent"
TV show demonstrating <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBNrq28ADQY">this skill</a>.</p>

Since moving to the UK, I have been working on a multitude of projects involving Estonian
diaspora abroad and introducing Estonia internationally. This includes initiatives such as co-founding the
<a href="http://www.oxbridgeestonia.org/">Oxford & Cambridge Club Estonia</a>,
coordinating the network of
<a href="http://cuest.soc.srcf.net/">Estonians in Cambridge, UK</a>, and
initiating and organising a 
<a href="http://noorteadlased.ee/">biannual meetings</a>
where scientists working abroad introduce their research as well as the
<a href="http://cambridgebalticconference.eu/">largest pan-Baltic conference</a>
outside the region introducing Estonia and the Baltic countries in the UK.</p>
