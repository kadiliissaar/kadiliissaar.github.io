	<h1>Welcome to the website of Kadi Liis Saar</h1>
	<p> Originally from Estonia, I moved to the UK for high school studies as an [HMC scholar][3] in 2009
and received my BA (*Hons*) and MEng (*Hons*) degree in chemical engineering and biotechnology from Trinity
College, University of Cambridge in 2014. In 2014, I also started my PhD studies in biophysical chemistry in
the [research group of prof. Tuomas Knowles][4] in the Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge,
during which I was also an [EMBO][5] visiting fellow in the [research group of prof. David Weitz][6] at the
Harvard University, USA and an elected programme associate at the Nanoscience and Nanotechnology DTC ([NanoDTC][7])
In 2018, I was awarded a fellowship by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council for post-doctoral
research.</p>
