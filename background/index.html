	<h2>My background</h2>
	<p> Originally from Estonia, I moved to the UK for high school studies as an
<a href="https://www.hmc.org.uk/about-hmc/projects/">HMC scholar</a>
in 2009 and received my BA (<i>Hons</i>) and MEng (<i>Hons</i>) degrees in chemical engineering and
biotechnology from Trinity College, University of Cambridge in 2014.</p>
		
	<p> In 2014, I started my PhD studies in biophysical chemistry in the
<a href="https://www-knowles.ch.cam.ac.uk/">research group of prof. Tuomas Knowles</a>
in the Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, during which I was also an
<a href="http://embo.org/">EMBO</a>
visiting fellow in the
<a href="https://weitzlab.seas.harvard.edu/">research group of prof. David Weitz</a>
at Harvard University.</p>
		
	<p>  In 2018, I was awarded a fellowship by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council for post-doctoral
research. As of 2019, I am working as a <a href="https://schmidtsciencefellows.org/">Schmidt Science Fellow</a> between the research groups of
<a href="https://www-knowles.ch.cam.ac.uk/">prof. Tuomas Knowles</a> and <a href="https://www.alpha-lee.com/"> Alpha Lee</a>. </p>
		
	<p>I care strongly about communicating my research and I have given numerous talks to high school
students and to general audience on topics such as chemical engineering, protein science, biophysics,
nanoscience. I am always open to talking to students or any other audiences about these topics or about
science and engineering more generally.</p>

	<p>Before starting my university studies, I was a world-ranked tennis player as a junior (Tennis Europe U16
#46; ITF Juniors No. #684, 22 times Estonian Junior Champion). Today, aside my academic career, I have worked on a
multitude of projects involving Estonian diaspora abroad and introducing Estonia internationally.
This includes initiatives such as co-founding the
<a href="http://www.oxbridgeestonia.org/">Oxford & Cambridge Club Estonia</a>,
coordinating the network of
<a href="http://cuest.soc.srcf.net/">Estonians in Cambridge, UK</a>, and
initiating and organising a biannual
<a href="http://noorteadlased.ee/">series of meetings</a>
where scientists working abroad introduce their research in Estonia and the
<a href="http://cambridgebalticconference.eu/">largest pan-Baltic conference</a>
outside the region introducing Estonia and the Baltic countries in the UK.</p>
