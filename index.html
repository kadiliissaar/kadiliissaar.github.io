	<p align="justify"> My interests revolve around developing new experimental technologies and computational approaches for healthcare,
in particular for the study of proteins and their interactions. My areas of expertise span from micron and nano scale
fabrication and flow engineering, single-molecule spectoscopy and single cell studies to advanced data analysis. Read
more about my research <a href="/academic-profile">here</a>.</p>
