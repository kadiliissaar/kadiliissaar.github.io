	<h1>Research Interests</h1>
	<p> Proteins are the executive molecules of life that through diverse set of highly integrated and tightly
regulated interactions set the molecular basis for our well-being. Yet the diverse and dynamic nature of proteomes
has made it challenging to devise strategies that could be effectively used for understanding the roles of proteins
in human health and disease.</p>
	<p> My current research is focuses on developing tools for probing protein behaviour inside cells in a
fully probe-free manner. I am using micron and nano scale fabrication and flow engineering approaches and combining
these with single molecule optical tools to perform high-throughput measurements on individual molecules in a
multi-dimensional space.</p>
		<p> During my PhD research, I devised platforms for probing dynamic heterogenous biomolecular
interactions under fully native conditions. This objective could be achieved when measurements are performed in
liquid phase. However, a fundamental challenge associated with analysis in solution is the tendency of diffusion
and random motion to oppose orderly separation and analysis. To probe biomolecular interactions on rapid time-scales
and directly in solution, I used a fundamentally different strategy for controlling molecular motion - I fabricated
micron scale structures in which fluids move in a laminar flow regime. Under such conditions, the chaotic mixing of
molecules was suppressed without the integration of matrices or other types of physical barriers, which opens up the
possibility to probe biomolecular interactions under fully native conditions and on rapid time-scales. This strategy
allowed me to create modular platforms which opened up new possibilities for studying protein behaviour. Specifically,
I developed an approach for characterising and sizing proteins and their complexes at an unprecedented resolution and
was involved in developing a novel label-free protein characterisation strategy reliant on multidimensional
physicochemical signatures of proteins. I also demonstrated the possibility to use these devices for probing
interactions between self-assembled protein species and their binding partners implicated in the onset of
neurodegenerative disorders, which had previously remained inaccessible due to the highly transient and heterogeneous
nature of self-assembling protein mixtures. My PhD thesis (undefended) can be found here.</p>
