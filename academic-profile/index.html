	<h2>Research Interests</h2>
	<p align="justify"> My research focusses on developing new experimental and predictive computational methods for understanding the
behaviour of biological molecules and systems, in particular proteins. Proteins are the executive molecules of life that
through diverse set of highly integrated and tightly regulated interactions set the molecular basis for our well-being.
Yet the diverse and dynamic nature of proteins has made it challenging to devise methods that could be effectively used
for understanding the roles of proteins in human health and disease</p>

	<p align="justify"> During my PhD research, I devised platforms for probing dynamic heterogenous biomolecular
interactions under fully native conditions. This objective could be achieved when measurements are performed in
liquid phase. A fundamental challenge associated with analysis in solution is the tendency of diffusion
and random motion to oppose orderly separation and analysis. To probe biomolecular interactions on rapid time-scales
and directly in solution, I used a different strategy for controlling molecular motion - I fabricated
micron scale structures in which fluids move in a laminar flow regime. Under such conditions, the chaotic mixing of
molecules is suppressed without the integration of matrices or other types of physical barriers, which opens up the
possibility to probe biomolecular interactions under fully native conditions and on rapid time-scales. This strategy
allowed me to create modular platforms which opened up new possibilities for probing protein behaviour. Specifically,
I developed an approach for characterising and sizing proteins and their complexes at an unprecedented resolution and I
was involved in developing a novel label-free protein characterisation strategy reliant on multidimensional
physicochemical signatures of proteins. I also demonstrated the possibility to use these devices for probing
interactions between self-assembled protein species and their binding partners implicated in the onset of
neurodegenerative disorders, which had previously remained inaccessible due to the highly transient and heterogeneous
nature of self-assembling protein mixtures. My PhD thesis (undefended) can be found here.</p>

	<h2>Areas of Expertise</h2>
<p align="justify"> I have extensive experience in micron and nano scale fabrication and flow engineering techniques, in
particular in soft-photolithography based microfluidics. I have used and created a range of biomolecular
separation and protein analysis tools and I have some experience in working with single molecule optical and
localisation tools. For data processing, I use custom-written codes in Python. </p>

	<h2>Research supervising</h2>
I have worked closely together with a number of PhD and master's degree students and supervised the following theses:
K. Yu. “Nanoengineering of Microfluidic Devices for Single Molecule Detection”. MRes in Micro- and Nanotechnology, 2019.
J. Smith “Developing a Strategy for Investigating Thermal Amyloid Aggregation in Real-Time and Label-Free Manner”. Part III (MSci) in Chemistry, 2018.


	<h2>Teaching</h2>
<p align="justify"> I have supervised Chemical Engineering undergraduate courses in "Process Calculations and Thermodynamics"
and in "Engineering Mathematics" and given seminars on "Microfluidics for biotechnological applications". </p>
